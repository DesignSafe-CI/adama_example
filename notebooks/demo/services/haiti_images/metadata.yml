  Wrap of the Haiti Earthquake database. On January 12, 2010 an
  earthquake ravaged Haiti (USGS, 2010). In the aftermath of the
  earthquake, a team of professors and students from Purdue
  University, the University of Washington, and the University of
  Kansas went to Haiti. The goal of the team was to evaluate the
  Priority Index proposed by Hassan and Sözen (1997).
